Khan Academy Test
=================

This plugin will allow you to set up a "*test*" with Khan Academy skills. Essentially,
it tracks when a student began and ends their test, and then will use Khan Academy's
API to get data on how the students performed on those skills during the time frame
of the test.

Still in alpha development.
